# KerningViews
KerningViews provides a set of views (currently only TextView and Button) which lets you adjust the spacing between the characters in the text of that view also know as **Kerning**.

Kerning is a common feature in designing apps like Photoshop or Sketch, but Android natively doesn't allow Kerning. Since API level 21, Android allows you to do this using ```setLetterSpacing``` attribute , but there is no way to achieve this in pre-21 devices.

KerningViews provides a simple API to achieve this feature in TextView and Button text.
